	Chibicon is a yearly convention around Japanese popular culture, like anime, manga, videogames and music. In 2010 this one-day convention will be held at 'Expo Center Houten' in Houten near Utrecht, the most central city of The Netherlands. With out central location and low ticketfee, we want to attract both newcomers and regulars to the scene.
